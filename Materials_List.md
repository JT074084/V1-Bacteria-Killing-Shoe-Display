Cooling and Chlorine Dioxide Fans: https://jlcmc.com/product/b/I08/BR5690/fa-%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A%E6%8E%A7%E5%88%B6-%E4%BD%8E%E5%8E%8B%E9%85%8D%E7%94%B5-%E7%94%B5%E6%B0%94%E8%BE%85%E6%9D%90-%E9%A3%8E%E6%89%87?k=INAF-80&productModelNumber=INAF-80 | Part Number: INAF-80

Drag Chain Middle Links: https://jlcmc.com/product/s/B11/BKLJ/cable-carrier-15-series-bridge-type-non-openable | Part Number: BKLJ-F20-R28-N30-BKTJ 
DRAG CHAIN NOTE: When I bought the drag chain for this project, I accidentally only selected the end links. To avoid the delivery wait, I actually ended up 3d printing the middle ones (I have the files for that in my STL files folder), but I noticed the 3d printed ones were pretty weak. So I found the middle links on JLCMC, and I recommend you use those. They’ll be of much higher quality than standard FDM printed ones.
2020A Aluminium Rail: https://jlcmc.com/product/s/T01/TXCJ/extruded-aluminum-t-slot-20-series(eu) | Part Number: TXCJ-H6-2020A-L200 (Note: You would need around 152mm of this stuff for the connection areas, but 200mm should definitely cover miscuts and stuff.)
2040 Aluminium Rail: https://jlcmc.com/product/s/T01/TXCJ/extruded-aluminum-t-slot-20-series(eu) | Part Number: TXCJ-H7-2040-L400 (Note: You need around 348mm of this for the shoe bed, but this should give you an extra 50mm.)
ALUMINIUM RAIL NOTE: I originally got my rail off of an old Ender 3 3D printer I had, but these should be the same size.
