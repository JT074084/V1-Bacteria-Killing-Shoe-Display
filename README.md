# V1 Bacteria Killing Shoe Display

These are all the files for V1 of the Bacteria Killing Shoe Display.

Keep in mind, I had pieced together the main ESP32 code from bits of code that either I or an LLM had written in the past, so if anything looks off/messy, that's probably why.

I apologize for the lack of a schematic/wiring diagram for this. Unfortunately, I was figuring out where everything should go as I was programming it, and I didn't really write anything down.

In the video, I didn't really get into the specifics of how everything fit together, but if you do decide to build this, I have included a "problems and pictures" doc. This document has a list of the different problems that V1 has, along with pictures to help show how things fit together.

Now, if you don't want to build this but saw some sort of component you liked, I've also included a "materials list" doc, which has all of the different parts I used, along with links to where you can get them.

Anyway, thank you for watching the video! I hope you enjoyed it! I have some ideas for a V2 that should be way cooler than this, but we'll have to see what happens next.
